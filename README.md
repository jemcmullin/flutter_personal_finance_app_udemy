# personal_expenses_app

Flutter project for learning in Udemy.

## General Idea

This is a single page Flutter application.

This project has two main visual areas:

- A chart in the top third with bar graphs for each day of expenses
- A list in the bottom two thirds for each transaction added

A user can add and delete transactions with the '+' buttons.
